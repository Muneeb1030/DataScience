## What is requirements.txt

`requirements.txt` is a file that specifies the dependencies of a Python project. It is used by the `pip` package manager to install dependencies of a project.

Having a `requirements.txt` file is better because it allows others to easily install the dependencies of your project. This makes it easier to work with your project, especially if you are collaborating with others.
